# Amazon Stock Forecasting with LSTM using PyTorch

## Overview
This project involves the forecasting of Amazon stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks implemented in PyTorch. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is well-suited for time series data, making it an excellent choice for stock price prediction.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Pytorch

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock prices of Amazon. This data is typically sourced from financial databases or APIs such as Yahoo Finance.

## Instructions
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file provided (`Amazon_Stock_Forecasting_with_LSTM.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.
4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and train the LSTM model.
5. Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the forecasted stock prices.

## Features
- Preprocessing of historical stock price data to prepare it for LSTM input.
- Implementation of LSTM neural network architecture using PyTorch.
- Training and evaluation of the LSTM model for Amazon stock price forecasting.
- Visualization of the predicted stock prices and comparison with actual prices.
